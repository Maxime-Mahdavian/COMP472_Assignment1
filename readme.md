This code runs on python 3.9. However, it should be able to run on python 3.8, but some warning messages might be different.
To run the text_classification code, the sklearn, matplotlib and os packages need to be installed. The os package is most
likely already installed, but for the other packages, you can use the command pip install <package_name> on the terminal to install them.

To run the drug classification code, the sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and warnings need to be installed.
The warnings package is most probably already installed, but you can use the command pip install <package_name> on the 
terminal to install them. 

To run both scripts, navigate to the folder on a terminal and run the command python3.9 text_classification.py or
python3.9 drug_classification.py
