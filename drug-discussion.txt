Here, the distribution of the classes are widely disproportionate, having way more instances of drugY than any other.
At the same time, there are very little instances of the drug C. This means that accuracy is not the best metric for this
situation. Instead, precision, recall or F1 measure are much better for this dataset.

The performance of the different classifiers varies depending on runs and different classifiers.
The first three, the gaussian and both decision trees,  are the simplest to analyze. They are very good overall, providing
very good precisions, recall and F1 values. They also don't change a lot per runs.
The last three are more complicated. The main reason is that the last three have issues where the classifiers don't pick
the drugs A,B and C in favor or X or Y. This is especially true of the perceptron and base mlp. The perceptron will sometimes
make better predictions and pick the drugs A,B and C. However, the base mlp is always pretty bad. The top-mlp with the best
classifiers is much better than the "default" one in the assignment. With this one, it rarely predicts drugs C though, only about
1 out of 5 times. Obviously, the precision, recall and F1 score are affected by this and tend to vary wildly depending if the
classifier picks the drugs or not.
It's normal that the performance varies, since the training set differs from run to run, which can affect the performance
of the classifier.
